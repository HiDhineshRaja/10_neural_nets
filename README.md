10 Neural Networks
------------------

An implementation of 10 simple neural networks in Matlab. The implementations don't have to necessarily be particularly elegant nor efficient - the goal is to ensure I continue to practice.

1. XOR_network_with_one_hidden_unit.m

    A network with a hidden unit as described in the problem outline of Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation by Rumelhart, Hinton and Willams 1985 (figure 2).

    Learning Objectives:
    * getting my feet wet with Matlab
    * generalizing the delta rule to training of neurons connecting to both the output neuron and the single intermittent, hidden neuron
